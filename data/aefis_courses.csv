AFRICAN,233,Global HipHop and Social Justice,"Can HipHop culture help produce a more just world? If so, what theory and praxis best advance this aim? These are the questions that drive this conceptual course. Our critical interrogation of the relationship between HipHop and social justice considers the culture from its U.S. Black Power era underpinnings to its disparate contemporary 'glocal' manifestations. We begin by asking what is 'HipHop,' what is 'social justice,' and what is their relationship, and proceed to consider how HipHop can be an effective force for social justice and what obstacles mitigate against this potential. These discussions will develop familiarity with important concepts in Black studies and social theory such as race and colonialism, imperialism and hegemony, structure and agency, identity and strategic essentialism. Weekly readings will typically pair writings specifically on HipHop with theory from across the humanities and social sciences including philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy. We will endeavor to consider the race/class/gender dimensions of our weekly topics. Students will acquire a broader familiarity with HipHop activism, and develop new conceptual tools and critical thinking skills.",104,AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE

AFRICAN,403,Theories of African Cultural Studies,"This course is a study of the many ways of understanding the entire spectrum of culture and cultural production, circulation, consumption, and meaning making in Africa. It foregrounds material and imaginative cultural forms and practices-their origins, languages, contents, forms, functions, genres, audiences-as well as how these have been conceived and theorized by practitioners and scholars in the context of Africa and the world. The course will also examine the uses to which particular meanings of culture and its forms are put, by whom, and to what purpose, and how meanings are fought over, reshaped, and reconstituted, and under what conditions those are or can be possible. This is what 'theory of African cultural studies' means in its most robust and imaginative senses. We will survey the entrenched modes of both conceptual and critical apprehension of the cultural forms and practices (from Negritude to postcolonialism and postmodernism), explore their methods of reading, raise the issue of their linkages to sources in Euro-America, and assess the extent to which the unique concerns of the biography of culture in Africa (expressed by its creators and scholars) have tried to tame and refashion what are now globally shared critical tools of cultural reading.",104,AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE

Students are engaged in active/process learning whereby the principles and themes presented in the lecture portion of the course are immediately put into practice in the laboratory component of the course. Expected learning outcomes and learning objectives are therefore integrated into each lecture and laboratory. Each subsequent learning objective builds upon the knowledge acquired from the previous learning objective thus developing a scaffold or framework from which to proceed. This course will present students with challenges from cognitive and affective domains as they process information from both biological and ethical perspectives. Problem solving and conflict resolution skills will be displayed as students challenge themselves with the development of fine motor/coordination based skills as well as understanding that the product of their efforts has the potential to result in a live offspring. The bovine (cow/bull) will serve as our model in this performance-based course as students are expected to demonstrate competency in the nuances and complexities associated with the production of embryos in a completely artificial (in vitro) environment. The student will be expected to demonstrate critical thinking by developing a simulated professional enterprise involving one or more of the assisted reproductive technologies they are exposed to. Students will demonstrate proficiency in and competency of in vitro maturation, fertilization, embryo development, cell culture, sterile bench technique, synchronization of the female estrus cycle, embryo transfer, non-surgical embryo recovery and cryopreservation by completing 2 complete cycles of embryo production in vitro. Students work in teams of 3-4 individuals. During the first production cycle students will perform all tasks while observing and working alongside of the instructor. The second production cycle will require the students to perform independently (of the instructor) who will only intervene in the event that the actions of the student will be lethal to the process and/or outcome. Each week (Monday) students will be presented with a controversial subject or topic related to cellular biology and/or reproduction. These ethical dilemmas are almost entirely within the realm of human assisted reproduction. Using any means and/or media desired, students are required to formulate responses in favor and in opposition of said topic. Each Friday, following the course quiz, students will be randomly selected to defend one side of the argument by articulating their viewpoint from the assigned perspective even if it is not their personal opinion. The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the nature and influence bioethics may have on policy decisions impacting future research endeavors and/or science based initiatives.

ART HIST,105,Introductory Topics in Art History,This is a seminar-type course primarily to be offered as a FIG coordinating course. Topics will vary.,180,ART HISTORY
ART HIST,201,History of Western Art I: From Pyramids to Cathedrals,"Examines the arts and cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean basin before the Renaissance. We explore canonical works such as the pyramids at Giza, the Parthenon in Athens, the Venus di Milo, Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Book of Kells, the Great Mosque at Cordoba, Chartres cathedral, and Giotto's Arena Chapel. But we also define art broadly, to encompass the material culture of everyday life, including jewelry, ceramics, and textiles. We consider the social and historical contexts of art and artistic production - art and imperialism, ethnicity, technology, religious ritual and belief, and myth and storytelling. These explorations address basic human concerns: death and the afterlife, desire and the body, self-definition and portraiture, power and propaganda, monstrosity and the supernatural, the divine and the sacred. We develop crucial skill sets: critical visual analysis, contextual interpretation, research methods and resources, historiography, and oral, written and digital communication. Students will apply these skills in assignments focused on works of art in the Chazen Museum.",180,ART HISTORY
ART HIST,202,History of Western Art II: From Renaissance to Contemporary,"Examines the arts and cultures of Europe and North America from the Renaissance through the present. Our discussions will explore important masterpieces by such renowned artists as Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt van Rijn, Claude Monet, Paul Cezanne, Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, and Frank Lloyd Wright alongside other works of fine art, architecture, the decorative arts, and photography. By studying the political, historical, social and cultural contexts of their making, we will begin to understand how certain works of art were valued from the moment of their making, fought over by different nations, bought, sold, stolen, or ignored for centuries and revived only recently for study. We will critically examine the concept of artistic genius; the influence of colonialism and imperialism on artistic production and consumption; the role of the patron and the art market in art's production and circulation; the relationship of fine art and popular culture; and the idea of globalization as it relates to 'western' artistic traditions. Students will develop skills in visual analysis that can help them understand artistic production over the past 500 years as well as succeed in today's visually oriented culture. They will also learn about dominant interpretive approaches and research tools in art history that have applicability across the humanities as well as digital applications that will help them create online exhibitions. Many assignments will focus on works of art in the Chazen Museum of Art.",180,ART HISTORY

ART HIST,205,Global Arts,"ART IS GLOBAL (and always has been). Today, we find Egyptian protest artists inspiring activists around the globe via the internet, but in earlier times, Roman glass and Buddhist icons moved along the ancient Silk Route, networks of exchange flourished in the medieval Mediterranean region, and colonial empires brought visual cultures into volatile contact. This course teaches students how to analyze images and objects produced through such exchanges that occurred around the world from ancient times through the contemporary. Its aims are to develop skills needed to live fully in a world in which borders are no barriers to the movement of images, objects, and ideas and to deepen understanding of cultural differences and interactions. By exploring works in a range of media and tracing processes of cross-cultural exchange, the course also develops sensitivity to visual and material form and a solid foundation in the practice of visual and material analysis.",180,ART HISTORY

ART HIST,227,The Ends of Modernism,"This course considers the end of Modernist art as it gives way to what is called, problematically, contemporary art. While the term modern may generally mean what is vanguard or current, Modernism indicates a period of art (and the humanities) ranging from, arguably, 1880-1950. By considering its end, one can study four pivotal aspects of the movement: its origins, themes, and afterlives, as well as the art and histories that challenge its coherence. In this thematic survey, then, Modernism will emerge as a heterogeneous set of images and attendant discourses which, negatively or positively, continue to work within the contemporary artistic and cultural moment.",180,ART HISTORY
ART HIST,241,Introduction to African Art and Architecture,"This course examines the rich heritage of African arts and architecture as they shape and have been shaped by the histories and cultural values (social, political, religious, philosophical, and aesthetic) of African peoples, both past and present, on the continent where humanity began. It includes an historical overview of selected artistic traditions from different parts of the continent from 26,000 BCE to the 21st century and thematic/cultural case studies: artists and aesthetics; textiles, decorative, and personal/body arts; architecture; and individual artists.",180,ART HISTORY

It is intended for students interested in any professional endeavor related to material culture, including careers in museums, galleries, historical societies, historic preservation organizations, and academic institutions. During the semester, students have varied opportunities to engage with and contemplate the material world to which people give meaning and which, in turn, influences their lives. Sessions combine in some way the following: presentations from faculty members and professionals who lecture on a phase of material culture related to his/her own scholarship or other professional work; discussion of foundational readings in the field; visits to collections and sites on campus and around Madison; discussion of readings assigned by visiting presenters or the professors; and exams and short papers that engage material culture topics.",180,ART HISTORY

The course is organized thematically around four topics: religious art as piety and politics; antiquity as a source of tradition and imagination; the formulation of a public discourse that exposed social threats; and the distinctiveness of artistic claims of individual achievement.

Works of art and other forms of material culture will be explored and discussed within the context of philosophical, historical, social, and cultural developments in the United States and across the globe. In this course, works of art and artifacts are interpreted not as passive objects that reflect history, but rather as active agents that are entwined with broader historical, social, and cultural events. A particular focus will be on the ways in which American art and material culture participates in the construction of identities - ranging from global identities and national identities (in particular, how notions of 'American' have been constructed) to regional, group and individual identities. Although the course will mainly cover works of painting, sculpture, and architecture, other forms of material culture, especially photography, decorative arts and popular illustrations, will also be considered. Attention will also be given to the writings of artists and critics, as well as texts by contemporary art historians, historians, and other scholars that illustrate the variety of methods that are currently being brought to bear on the interpretation of American art, architecture, and material culture. Students will learn skills that will help them construct histories of American art and material culture in written narratives (papers) as well as in online exhibitions through a series of short research exercises.

ART HIST,413,Art and Architecture in the Age of the Caliphs,"The tenth century CE marked a period of drastic change in the Islamic world, as the unified Islamic caliphate splintered into three rival dynasties: the Sunni Iraqi Abbasids, Spanish Umayyads, and the Shi'ite Fatimids in Egypt. In their quest to dominate the Islamic world and control the Mediterranean, each dynasty openly competed and responded to the others in architectural projects, ceremonial practices and courtly arts. At the same time, the monolithic model of courtly patronage of the arts was replaced gradually by one in which the urban classes increasingly shaped the art market, resulting in new visual forms. This course considers this turning point in the history of Islamic culture through the lens of art and architectural patronage. By exploring the architectural and urban projects of the three dynasties, we will examine competing visions of power, sources of legitimacy and the development of Cairo, Baghdad/Samarra and Cordoba as capital cities. We will also consider the role of portable arts, addressing the role of exchange and gift-giving in the Mediterranean context and the problems of attribution in this highly mobile environment. Course themes include the role of sectarian identity (Shi'ite vs Sunni); the incorporation of Christian and Jewish culture; the relation between the court and urban populations; and the meaning of ornament and style in Islamic art.",180,ART HISTORY

CLASSICS,150,Ancient Greek and Roman Monsters,"Ancient monsters were forces of chaos that threatened the natural order of the universe: they had to be contained, banished to the edges of the world or destroyed. But the Greeks and Romans also believed them to be magical beings that held the promise of special knowledge - of the past, of dangers to be faced, of musical arts - or which, like the Sphinx, possessed an enigmatic  intelligence capable of fooling all but the most cunning of mortals. In this course we investigate these contrasting aspects of ancient monsters, drawing directly on texts (in translation) and works of art through which the Greeks and Romans explored the monstrous and its place in their world. We also compare ancient representations with those in modern artistic media - comics, games, stories and movies - considering both how our notions of the monstrous are influenced by or contrast with those of our ancient predecessors, and how our very identities are created by and enacted through our depictions of monsters.",244,CLASSICS

Finally, we will consider a number of prominent religions that came into conflict with Roman authorities - especially the mystery cults surrounding Bacchus as well as early Christianity. We will also have the opportunity to bring to bear the insights gleaned from the ancient world on the modern one in our consideration of such modern conspiracies as the Salem Witch Trials, the Red Scare of the '50s, the Kennedy Assassination, and the Watergate Conspiracy.

GEN&WS,346,Trans/Gender in Historical Perspective,"Throughout recorded history, humans have conceptualized categories of sex and gender in a variety of ways; some have elaborated just two main sex/genders, others have elaborated more than two categories. At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such as racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe, the African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender.

GERMAN,275,Kafka and the Kafkaesque,"Franz Kafka (1883-1924) is an author whose impact on world literature cannot be overestimated. Born an Austrian Jew and living in the German-speaking Diaspora of Prague, he spent his days making a living as a successful employee of an insurance company and his nights desperately trying to create fiction that met his own exacting expectations. Constantly at odds with the demands of his family, friends, and fiancees/female acquaintances and plagued by poor health, Franz Kafka struggled his entire life long to reconcile the irreconcilable: life and writing. Kafka's texts demand a transdisciplinary and comparative approach. They forged a new level and quality of literature that has triggered innumerable responses in many languages, media, and discourses. The term 'Kafkaesque' makes clear that the type and dimension of Kafka's texts have been perceived as strange, uncanny, and resistant to any classification. In the attempt to adopt or imitate the Kafkaesque, other authors situate themselves in the literary tradition of the uncanny, which in part relies on the mystified city of Prague with its long Jewish tradition, as well as on the tradition of Romantic and 'Gothic' texts. In this course, we will read a wide selection of texts by Franz Kafka in order to approach an understanding of his universe and prepare ourselves to view this universe in comparison with other contemporary authors as well as authors from other cultures and eras (A. Camus,, W. G. Sebald, T. Pynchon, H. Mulisch, P. Roth, H. Murakami). Lectures will also highlight literature, film, and art works in the tradition of the Kafkaesque.",424,GERMAN

HISTORY,346,Trans/Gender in Historical Perspective,"Throughout recorded history, humans have conceptualized categories of sex and gender in a variety of ways; some have elaborated just two main sex/genders, others have elaborated more than two categories. At the same time, regardless of how a given culture has defined sex and gender and the behaviors and appearances deemed appropriate, humans have always exceeded those definitions. Quite simply, the determination of male and female and any other sex or gender category is neither obvious nor simple: what is sex, what is gender? Do they reside in the body, behavior, psyche, clothing, or social processes such as racialization? To make matters still more complicated, cultural beliefs about sex/gender have changed across time. How have contacts across cultures through migration and colonization affected people's understanding of sex/gender possibilities and norms? This course focuses on sex/gender crossing and variation in historical contexts including Japan, South Africa, Europe, the African diaspora, and North America. We will consider perspectives of people who themselves passed, crossed, transitioned, transed, or otherwise exceeded their culture's definitions of normative sex/gender. Alongside, we will consider the ways that dominant social institutions reinforced norms, recognized, tolerated, punished and/or celebrated gender variation. We will examine popular culture, medical and legal perspectives, memoir, queer and trans theory, and social movement treatises.",448,HISTORY

HISTORY,350,The First World War and the Shaping of Twentieth-Century Europe,"The experience and legacy of the First World War has been linked to nearly every social, cultural, and political transformation that marked the short century that followed: mobilization and the experience of total war transformed the relations between governments and citizens, between men and women, and between social classes. Europeans experienced death on an unprecedented scale and came to terms with new forms of industrialized warfare, from the use of poison gas to modern practices of genocide. Europeans now learned to live with violence, both during as well as after the war, and found new ways to mourn or remember the dead. This course will explore such themes. Using a wide variety of contemporary sources -- memoirs, essays, poems, or cinematic representations -- we will try to situate the upheaval of 1914-1918 within the larger framework of twentieth-century European history.",448,HISTORY

Though focused on a specific revolutionary era, the course also aims to reflect on timeless questions: Why is it so difficult to create democracy? Is violence ever justified to overcome oppression and injustice? Finally, why did this experiment in radical democracy also unleash the Terror and launch Napoleon Bonaparte, the politician and general who built an astonishing European Empire?

How was  soft power  implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency.

Like at no other time, our world--the natural world, from storm systems to diseases; governments and companies; and our conversations with friends and relatives, even our movements--is recorded in digital format.

(An exabyte is 1 trillion megabytes.) The result is that professional communicators in journalism and mass communication, as well as researchers and private firms, now literally have more data than they know what to do with. There is tremendous need across our society for people who are able to use data to investigate important questions, draw useful insights from those data, and communicate those insights to others--and also to be realistic and honest about what data can and cannot do. That is what this class is for: it is an introduction to the world of data, how data can be used to answer questions and those answers can be effectively and ethically communicated. More specifically, we will offer a combination of conceptual training, instruction in specific tools for data analysis and visualization, and the opportunity to put new skills to use in a final project.

L I S,677,Concepts and Tools for Data Analysis and Visualization,"Ours has become a data society. Like at no other time, our world--the natural world, from storm systems to diseases; governments and companies; and our conversations with friends and relatives, even our movements--is recorded in digital format. A few years ago, Google CEO Eric Schmidt famously stated that 'There was 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days, and the pace is increasing.' (An exabyte is 1 trillion megabytes.) The result is that professional communicators in journalism and mass communication, as well as researchers and private firms, now literally have more data than they know what to do with. There is tremendous need across our society for people who are able to use data to investigate important questions, draw useful insights from those data, and communicate those insights to others--and also to be realistic and honest about what data can and cannot do. That is what this class is for: it is an introduction to the world of data, how data can be used to answer questions and those answers can be effectively and ethically communicated. More specifically, we will offer a combination of conceptual training, instruction in specific tools for data analysis and visualization, and the opportunity to put new skills to use in a final project.

International relations theorists have defined soft power as  the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion.  This graduate seminar will put this notion to the test. We will investigate how elites, interest groups, religious bodies, and nation-states seek to exercise hegemony in the international order through non-violent means. How was  soft power  implemented on the ground in the 20th century- and how did its use transform international relations? To probe these questions, we will focus on a series of case studies in European and U.S. international history. Topics covered include the expansion of capitalism and consumer culture; the globalization of international legal instruments and human rights claims; and de-secularization, religious radicalism, and counter-insurgency.
